# Project Overview: Smart Drive Vehicle

Welcome to the Smart Drive Vehicle project's GitHub repository! Here, we'll provide you with an overview of our exciting endeavor to create an advanced smart driving system. Below, you'll find key components and details about our project.

## Firmware Development (STM32 Code)

At the heart of the Smart Drive Vehicle project is the development of advanced firmware. We are actively working on creating firmware that will power a wide range of features and peripherals within our smart driving system. Our STM32 code is at the core of this development, and it will enable various functionalities, including:

- Real-time vehicle control
- Sensor data processing
- Communication with external devices
- 
## GUI using Raspberry Pi

To provide a user-friendly interface for our Smart Drive Vehicle, we are developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using a Raspberry Pi. This GUI will serve as the primary means of interacting with and controlling the vehicle's functions. Key features of the GUI will include:

- Intuitive controls for vehicle navigation
- Real-time data display, including distance and speed readings
- System status monitoring
- Error and warning notifications


## Presentation

In addition to the technical aspects of our project, we are committed to effectively communicating our progress and findings. Our presentation materials will include:

- **Slides:** We'll provide detailed slides outlining the project's goals, methodologies, and results. These slides will be helpful for understanding our project's high-level overview and its significance.

- **Videos:** We plan to create informative videos that showcase the features and capabilities of our Smart Drive Vehicle. These videos will serve as visual aids for better comprehension and engagement.

## Image

A picture is worth a thousand words. We will include images that visually represent our project.Our images will provide a visual context for our project, making it easier to understand and appreciate.

## Proteus Simulation

To ensure the effectiveness and safety of our smart driving system, we utilize Proteus Simulation. Proteus allows us to simulate various scenarios and test the system's functionality without the need for physical implementation. In this section, we will:

- Describe the simulations we have conducted
- Share simulation results
- Explain how these simulations contribute to the project's development
By using Proteus Simulation, we can fine-tune our system before deploying it in real-world scenarios, enhancing the overall reliability and performance.
